# Run Dos Run!

## The videogame
### What is?
Run Dos Run! is a web-based videogame. The style is inspired on the run scapes and puzzle runs games such as [SuperHexagon](http://superhexagon.com/) or [Run](http://www.kongregate.com/games/player_03/run-2?thumb=site). It's build on [Vanilla JS](http://www.ecmascript.org/) and powered by [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). It's cross-platform because it run on the web and it'll be mobilelike soon! This game was made for academic purposes and it's under the GNU License. 

### That name, why?
Run Dos Run! is a play on words. The origin is this: `C:\Dos\Run`  and the fast understanding is for geeks only. The joke is based on the relationship blocks written in a book for children in North America well-known phrase. The book was written to help children build sentences. This book contains the phrases: "See Spot. See Spot Run. Run Spot Run". The relationship exists because the letter C is pronounced as "See", which trailed to the MS-DOS command would be "See DOS. See DOS Run. Run DOS Run ". A transpolation of this would be like "Look at DOS. Look at running DOS. Run DOS Run". What is a phrase similar to the pronunciation in Forrest Gump: "run Forrest, run". Perhaps, a bit weird I guess :P

### How to play?
Run Dos Run! it's builded over Phaser so the better option is to run the game inside a local phaser server. At the official web there is a [fantastic documentation](http://phaser.io/getting-started-js2.php) about how to rise a local phaser host. I recommend the [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) option because their simplicity. If you clone the repo outside the phaser server it'll work, too. But you can't load the assets because the browser client security protocols.
Anyway, the easiest option is to access to our official host of Run Dos Run! following the next link:

### Misc
Run Dos Run! was made by Rubén Sospedra for academic purposes. Any resemblance to another product is strictly coincidental. This game is non-profit. The goal of the game -- as you can read while playing -- is to provide a chill space where you can free your mind and relax. Give to Run Dos Run! the chance to unwind you.
